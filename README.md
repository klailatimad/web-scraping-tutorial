## Sample Projects

Practical application enhances learning. That's why we've provided two sample projects that offer a hands-on approach to utilizing the concepts and techniques discussed in this tutorial. These projects demonstrate the use of two popular Python libraries for web scraping: `BeautifulSoup` and `Scrapy`.

### 1. [Scraping Patek.com with Scrapy](./projects/patek-scraping/README.md)

This project showcases the power and flexibility of `Scrapy`, a comprehensive web scraping framework in Python. We've targeted Patek.com for this task, extracting detailed information about various watch models. You'll find everything you need to understand, run, and learn from this real-world example in the project's directory, including the script, sample output data, and a detailed walkthrough of the code.

### 2. [Scraping Blancpain with BeautifulSoup](https://chat.openai.com/c/projects/blancpain-scraping/README.md) _(Coming Soon)_

Our second project takes a different approach, using `BeautifulSoup` to scrape data from Blancpain's website. While `BeautifulSoup` might not be as comprehensive as `Scrapy`, it's perfect for simpler scraping tasks and can sometimes be all you need for your data extraction purposes. This project will walk you through a practical example of how to use `BeautifulSoup` for web scraping. The project's folder, once uploaded, will contain the script, sample data, and an extensive guide to understanding each step of the process.
